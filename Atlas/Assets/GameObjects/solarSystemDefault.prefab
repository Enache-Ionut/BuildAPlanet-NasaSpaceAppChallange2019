      value: The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world
        with a very thin atmosphere.  This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice
        caps and weather and canyons and extinct volacanoes, evidence of an even
        more active past. Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system,
        and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
        NASA currently has three spacecraft in orbit, one rover and one lander on
        the surface and another rover under construction here on Earth. India and
        ESA also have spacecraft in orbit above Mars. These robotic explorers have
        found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker
        atmosphere, billions of years ago.

        2017, a global research team found hydrogen sulfide, the odiferous gas that
        most people avoid, in Uranus\u2019 cloud tops\u2014a striking difference
        from the gas giant planets located closer to the Sun. The first planet found
        with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer
        William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or
        a star. It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as
        a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert
        Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus
        after King George III. Instead the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek
        god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode. "
